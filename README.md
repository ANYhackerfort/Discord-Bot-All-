This includes all the python files for all my bots. All the logics are free to use and some are inefficient which I will fix later on. Yes you are free to use everything here, just don't sell my ideas as your own! 
Please remember that these bot IDs no longer work. 
I use a mac which might be different if you are running on windows.
